Meme Folder is an iOS application that allows users to download videos straight to their phone from Twitter. I made it because the Internet is a "[perpetually burning library of Alexandria](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1419066243307368448)" and if you want to save something cool you have to grab it locally.

Sadly, Apple thought that this app was too similar to other ones on the App Store, despite mine not having any paywalls or ads. Oh well!
